# PIPEX
This project is about creating a program that simulates the pipe operator in bash.
The program will take in a file as input, another as output, and two commands as arguments.
The first command will be executed and its output will be passed as input to the second command.
The output of the second command will be written to a file.
The program will also have the ability to handle multiple pipes.
